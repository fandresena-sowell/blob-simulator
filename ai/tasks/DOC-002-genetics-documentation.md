# DOC-002: Document the Slime Genetics System

## Reference Files
The following files should be referenced when working on this task:
- ai/TODO.md (For understanding project context and dependencies)
- ai/tasks/SIM-001-slime-dna-genetics.md (DNA system implementation)
- ai/tasks/SIM-005-slime-reproduction.md (Reproduction system)
- ai/tasks/EVO-001-natural-selection.md (Natural selection system)
- src/actors/slime.ts (Slime implementation with genetics)

## Overview
Create comprehensive documentation for the slime genetics system, explaining how traits are encoded, inherited, expressed, and how they affect simulation behavior. This documentation will help users understand the evolutionary mechanics of the simulation.

## Requirements
- Document the structure and encoding of slime DNA
- Explain how genetic traits affect slime appearance and behavior
- Describe the inheritance and mutation mechanics
- Provide examples of how natural selection operates on these traits
- Create visual aids to help understand genetic concepts

## Init
- [ ] Read existing documentation and acknowledge the project
- [ ] Review the slime genetics implementation
- [ ] Plan the structure and format of the genetics documentation

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create a basic outline of genetics documentation topics
- [ ] Document the DNA data structure and encoding
- [ ] Explain how traits are expressed in slimes
- [ ] Document the inheritance system during reproduction
- [ ] Explain mutation mechanics and probabilities
- [ ] Describe how natural selection operates on traits
- [ ] Create visual diagrams of the genetics system
- [ ] Add examples of genetic adaptation to different environments
- [ ] Document trait correlations and trade-offs
- [ ] Create a genetics glossary for technical terms
- [ ] Add visual examples of trait expressions in slimes
- [ ] Document any "hidden" traits or advanced genetic mechanics
- [ ] Implement documentation in appropriate format (HTML, PDF, in-app)

## Success Criteria
- Documentation clearly explains the genetics system architecture
- Users can understand how traits are inherited and mutated
- Documentation illustrates how traits affect slime behavior
- Visual aids effectively illustrate genetic concepts
- Content is technically accurate and aligned with implementation

## Dependencies
- SIM-001: Slime DNA/Genetics System
- SIM-005: Slime Reproduction (for inheritance mechanics)
- EVO-001: Natural Selection (for evolutionary mechanics)

## Notes
- Balance technical accuracy with accessibility for non-technical users
- Use consistent terminology throughout the documentation
- Visual aids are critical for understanding complex genetic concepts
- Consider including examples of evolutionary outcomes
- May want to include a section on "hacking" or customizing the genetics system

## Post-process
- [ ] Have genetics implementation developers review for accuracy
- [ ] Test documentation clarity with users of different backgrounds

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All implementation steps completed
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] Documentation thoroughly reviewed for accuracy
- [ ] Task fully addresses all requirements
- [ ] No factual errors or misleading explanations
- [ ] Documentation covers all genetics features
- [ ] Content is clear and well-organized

## Final Steps
- [ ] Mark the task as completed in TODO.md
- [ ] Commit the changes with a conventional commit message format
