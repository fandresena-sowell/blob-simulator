# PERF-002: Implement Spatial Partitioning for Collision Detection

## Reference Files
The following files should be referenced when working on this task:
- ai/TODO.md (For understanding project context and dependencies)
- src/level.ts (Level that manages collision detection)
- src/actors/slime.ts (Slime collision implementation)
- ai/tasks/ENV-001-bounded-world.md (World boundaries implementation)

## Overview
Implement spatial partitioning techniques to optimize collision detection between slimes and other entities in the simulation. This will significantly improve performance when dealing with large numbers of entities by reducing the number of collision checks needed.

## Requirements
- Implement an efficient spatial partitioning system
- Optimize collision detection for large numbers of entities
- Ensure collision detection remains accurate
- Make the system adaptable to different world sizes and entity densities
- Add debug visualization for spatial partitioning

## Init
- [ ] Read existing documentation and acknowledge the project
- [ ] Understand the current collision detection implementation
- [ ] Research spatial partitioning techniques suitable for this project

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create a `SpatialPartitioning` class or system
- [ ] Implement a grid-based or quadtree partitioning structure
- [ ] Modify entity management to register with the spatial system
- [ ] Update the collision detection logic to use spatial queries
- [ ] Optimize entity movement and partition updates
- [ ] Add dynamic resizing or rebalancing of the partitioning structure
- [ ] Implement broad-phase and narrow-phase collision detection
- [ ] Create debug visualization for partitions and queries
- [ ] Add performance monitoring tools specific to collision detection
- [ ] Optimize for common collision patterns in the simulation
- [ ] Implement object pooling for collision data structures
- [ ] Create a configuration system for spatial partitioning parameters

## Success Criteria
- Collision detection performance scales well with increased entity count
- Accurate collision detection is maintained
- System adapts to different world sizes and entity distributions
- Debug visualization helps identify optimization opportunities
- Significant performance improvement over naive collision detection

## Dependencies
- ENV-001: Bounded World with Borders (for defining partitioning boundaries)

## Notes
- Consider different partition strategies based on entity density and distribution
- Balance memory usage with performance improvement
- Think about dynamic vs. static partitioning based on simulation patterns
- Consider special handling for very fast-moving entities
- The partitioning strategy may need to integrate with other spatial systems (e.g., AI sensing)
