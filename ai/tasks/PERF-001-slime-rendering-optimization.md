# PERF-001: Optimize Rendering for Large Numbers of Slimes

## Reference Files
The following files should be referenced when working on this task:
- ai/TODO.md (For understanding project context and dependencies)
- src/actors/slime.ts (Slime rendering implementation)
- src/level.ts (Level rendering management)
- src/main.ts (Game configuration)

## Overview
Implement optimization techniques to ensure smooth rendering performance when the simulation contains a large number of slimes. This is crucial for running complex simulations with many agents without degrading the user experience.

## Requirements
- Optimize rendering to handle hundreds or thousands of slimes
- Maintain stable frame rate even with large populations
- Implement graphics optimizations without significantly compromising visual quality
- Create fallback rendering modes for lower-end devices
- Add performance monitoring tools

## Init
- [ ] Read existing documentation and acknowledge the project
- [ ] Establish baseline performance metrics with various slime populations
- [ ] Identify current rendering bottlenecks

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Implement sprite batching for similar slimes
- [ ] Create an instance rendering system for efficient GPU utilization
- [ ] Add culling for off-screen slimes
- [ ] Implement level-of-detail (LOD) rendering based on distance/zoom
- [ ] Optimize animation updates based on visibility and distance
- [ ] Add frame rate throttling options
- [ ] Create simplified rendering modes for large populations
- [ ] Implement object pooling for slime actors
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics display
- [ ] Create automatic quality adjustment based on performance
- [ ] Optimize texture memory usage with sprite atlases
- [ ] Implement debug visualization for render optimization

## Success Criteria
- Simulation maintains at least 30 FPS with 1000+ slimes on mid-range hardware
- Visual quality remains acceptable at high population counts
- No significant memory leaks or increasing GPU/CPU usage over time
- Performance degrades gracefully on lower-end devices

## Dependencies
- None (but should be implemented before or alongside other performance tasks)

## Notes
- Consider the balance between visual fidelity and performance
- Different optimization techniques may be needed for mobile vs. desktop
- Profile and benchmark regularly throughout implementation
- Consider implementing a benchmark mode for testing performance
- WebGL-specific optimizations should be considered
