# UI-004: Implement Save/Load Functionality

## Reference Files
The following files should be referenced when working on this task:
- ai/TODO.md (For understanding project context and dependencies)
- src/main.ts (Game configuration)
- src/level.ts (Simulation state)
- src/actors/slime.ts (Slime state to be saved/loaded)
- ai/tasks/SIM-001-slime-dna-genetics.md (DNA system that needs to be serializable)

## Overview
Implement functionality to save the current state of the simulation and load it later, allowing users to preserve interesting evolutionary scenarios or continue experiments across multiple sessions.

## Requirements
- Create a system to serialize the complete simulation state
- Implement UI controls for saving and loading simulations
- Allow naming and managing multiple saved states
- Ensure all important simulation parameters are correctly saved and restored
- Add optional auto-save functionality

## Init
- [ ] Read existing documentation and acknowledge the project
- [ ] Understand the current state management in the simulation
- [ ] Research serialization approaches in Excalibur.js

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create a `SaveManager` class to handle serialization and deserialization
- [ ] Implement methods to capture the complete simulation state
- [ ] Create serialization logic for slimes and their genetic information
- [ ] Add serialization for environmental features and settings
- [ ] Implement UI controls for save/load operations
- [ ] Create a save file format with versioning support
- [ ] Add functionality to name and manage multiple saved states
- [ ] Implement file storage using browser localStorage or file system API
- [ ] Create validation to ensure loaded saves are compatible
- [ ] Add visual feedback during save/load operations
- [ ] Implement optional auto-save functionality with configurable intervals
- [ ] Create import/export functionality for sharing saves

## Success Criteria
- Users can save the current simulation state
- Saved simulations can be loaded with all properties restored
- Multiple saved states can be managed
- All critical simulation elements are properly serialized and deserialized
- Save/load process is intuitive and provides appropriate feedback

## Dependencies
- SIM-001: Slime DNA/Genetics System (needs to be serializable)
- All other simulation systems that need to be saved/restored

## Notes
- Consider using JSON for serialization with custom type handling
- Think about save file versioning for future compatibility
- Balance save file size with completeness of saved state
- Consider implementing a save file browser/manager
- May need to use Web Storage API or IndexedDB for larger save files

## Post-process
- [ ] Update project documentation to reflect the changes made
- [ ] Document the save/load system and file format

- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Implementation thoroughly tested
- [ ] Documentation updated as needed

## Final Steps
- [ ] Mark the task as completed in TODO.md
- [ ] Commit the changes with a conventional commit message format
