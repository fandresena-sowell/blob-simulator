## Reference Files
The following files should be referenced when working on this task:
- ai/TODO.md (For understanding project context and dependencies)
- src/actors/slime.ts (Slime behavior implementation)
- ai/tasks/SIM-006-slime-ai.md (Basic slime AI implementation)
- ai/tasks/PERF-003-level-of-detail.md (LOD system)
- ai/tasks/PERF-002-spatial-partitioning.md (Spatial partitioning)

## Overview
Optimize the AI and behavior calculations for slimes to efficiently handle large populations without compromising the quality of the simulation. This task focuses on reducing the computational overhead of decision-making, pathfinding, and other AI-related processes.

## Requirements
- Optimize AI calculations to scale with large numbers of slimes
- Implement prioritization for AI updates
- Create efficient sensing and perception systems
- Optimize decision-making algorithms
- Implement AI computation distribution across frames

## Init
- [ ] Read existing documentation and acknowledge the project
- [ ] Understand the current AI implementation
- [ ] Profile and identify AI computation bottlenecks

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create an `AIScheduler` to manage and prioritize AI updates
- [ ] Implement time-slicing for AI calculations across multiple frames
- [ ] Add priority-based AI updating (higher detail for important or visible slimes)
- [ ] Optimize sensing and perception using spatial partitioning
- [ ] Implement simplified decision-making for distant or less important slimes
- [ ] Create approximation techniques for group behavior
- [ ] Add caching for expensive AI calculations
- [ ] Implement AI computation budgeting based on available performance
- [ ] Create adaptive AI complexity based on population size
- [ ] Optimize pathfinding for large numbers of entities
- [ ] Add worker thread support for AI calculations where appropriate
- [ ] Implement debug visualization and metrics for AI performance

## Success Criteria
- AI calculations scale effectively with large populations
- Behavior quality remains high for important/visible slimes
- Overall simulation performance remains stable with 1000+ slimes
- Emergent behaviors still occur despite optimizations
- AI computation is balanced with rendering and physics needs

## Dependencies
- SIM-006: Basic Slime AI
- PERF-002: Spatial Partitioning for Collision Detection (can be leveraged for AI)
- PERF-003: Level of Detail System (for integrating with AI simplification)

## Notes
- Balance between computation accuracy and performance
- Consider using different AI models based on distance/importance
- Think about emergent behavior preservation despite optimizations
- Consider group-based AI for clusters of similar slimes
- Look into applying flocking or similar algorithms for efficient group movement
