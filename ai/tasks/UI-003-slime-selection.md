# UI-003: Add Ability to Select and Track Individual Slimes

## Reference Files
The following files should be referenced when working on this task:
- ai/TODO.md (For understanding project context and dependencies)
- src/actors/slime.ts (Slime implementation)
- src/level.ts (Level with slimes)
- ai/tasks/SIM-001-slime-dna-genetics.md (DNA system for displaying traits)

## Overview
Implement functionality that allows users to select and track individual slimes, enabling them to monitor specific slimes' traits, behavior, and lifecycle events. This feature will enhance user engagement and provide deeper insights into the simulation.

## Requirements
- Allow users to click/tap on slimes to select them
- Display detailed information about selected slimes
- Implement visual indicator to highlight the selected slime
- Add ability to follow/track a selected slime as it moves
- Show detailed genetic and behavioral statistics for selected slimes

## Init
- [ ] Read existing documentation and acknowledge the project
- [ ] Understand Excalibur.js input handling and UI capabilities
- [ ] Review the slime and DNA implementations

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Implement click/tap detection for slime actors
- [ ] Create a selection indicator (e.g., highlight, outline) for the selected slime
- [ ] Add a detail panel that shows information about the selected slime
- [ ] Implement camera following for the selected slime (optional toggle)
- [ ] Display genetic traits information from the DNA system
- [ ] Show current energy level, age, and reproduction status
- [ ] Add lifecycle event tracking for the selected slime
- [ ] Implement deselection functionality
- [ ] Create way to remember previously selected slimes (favorites or history)
- [ ] Add statistics comparison between multiple selected slimes (optional)
- [ ] Implement search or filter functionality to find slimes with specific traits

## Success Criteria
- Users can click on slimes to select them
- Selected slime is visually highlighted
- Detailed information about the selected slime is displayed
- User can track selected slime as it moves around
- Selection system integrates with all existing slime properties and behaviors

## Dependencies
- SIM-001: Slime DNA/Genetics System (for displaying traits)
- UI-001: Information Panel (optional integration)

## Notes
- Keep the selection visual indicator distinct but not overwhelming
- Consider how selection will work with large numbers of slimes
- Think about multi-selection for comparing slimes
- Consider how to handle selection when slimes die or reproduce
- Balance detail vs. clarity in the information display

## Post-process
- [ ] Update project documentation to reflect the changes made
- [ ] Document the slime selection and tracking features

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All implementation steps completed
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] Selection system thoroughly tested with various scenarios
- [ ] Task fully addresses all requirements
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Implementation thoroughly tested
- [ ] Documentation updated as needed

## Final Steps
- [ ] Mark the task as completed in TODO.md
- [ ] Commit the changes with a conventional commit message format
