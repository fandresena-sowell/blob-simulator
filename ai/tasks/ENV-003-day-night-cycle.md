# ENV-003: Implement Day/Night Cycle

## Reference Files
The following files should be referenced when working on this task:
- ai/TODO.md (For understanding project context and dependencies)
- src/level.ts (Level implementation to be modified)
- src/main.ts (Game configuration)
- src/actors/slime.ts (Slime behavior affected by day/night)

## Overview
Implement a day/night cycle system that affects the environment and slime behavior, creating a more dynamic and realistic ecosystem with time-based changes.

## Requirements
- Create a visual day/night cycle with lighting changes
- Implement a time system with configurable day length
- Make environment properties change based on time of day
- Affect slime behavior based on time of day
- Add visual effects for sunrise, sunset, and other key times

## Init
- [ ] Read existing documentation and acknowledge the project
- [ ] Understand the current level implementation and rendering system

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create a `TimeSystem` class to manage day/night cycle
- [ ] Implement a time progression mechanism with configurable speed
- [ ] Add a lighting system that changes based on time of day
- [ ] Create visual effects for the sky that reflect time of day
- [ ] Implement environment property changes based on time (temperature, visibility)
- [ ] Modify food spawn rates based on time of day
- [ ] Add time-based behavior modifiers for slimes
- [ ] Create visual indicators for current time of day (sun/moon position, UI clock)
- [ ] Implement day/night transition effects (sunset/sunrise)
- [ ] Add optional time-specific events or phenomena
- [ ] Create a configurable system for time-based parameters

## Success Criteria
- Clear visual distinction between day and night
- Smooth transitions between different times of day
- Environment properties change based on time
- Slime behavior is affected by time of day
- Time system is configurable and flexible

## Dependencies
- None (but will integrate with ENV-002: Environmental Features and ENV-004: Weather Effects)

## Notes
- Consider how day/night will affect visibility and slime navigation
- Think about nocturnal vs. diurnal behavior patterns for different slime types
- Balance the cycle length to create meaningful patterns without being too slow
- Consider how the day/night cycle will integrate with future weather systems

## Post-process
- [ ] Update project documentation to reflect the changes made
- [ ] Document the time system parameters and effects

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All implementation steps completed
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] Day/night cycle thoroughly tested over multiple cycles
- [ ] Task fully addresses all requirements
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Implementation thoroughly tested
- [ ] Documentation updated as needed

## Final Steps
- [ ] Mark the task as completed in TODO.md
- [ ] Commit the changes with a conventional commit message format
