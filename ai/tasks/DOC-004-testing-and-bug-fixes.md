# DOC-004: Final Testing and Bug Fixes

## Reference Files
The following files should be referenced when working on this task:
- ai/TODO.md (For understanding project context and dependencies)
- All implementation files in the project

## Overview
Conduct comprehensive testing across all aspects of the slime ecosystem simulator, identify and fix any bugs, ensure compatibility across different browsers and devices, and polish the user experience before final release.

## Requirements
- Test all simulation features thoroughly
- Identify and fix all critical bugs
- Ensure cross-browser and cross-device compatibility
- Optimize performance in edge cases
- Polish visual elements and user interactions

## Init
- [ ] Read existing documentation and acknowledge the project
- [ ] Create a comprehensive testing plan
- [ ] Set up testing environments for different platforms

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create a test matrix covering all features and functions
- [ ] Implement automated tests where possible
- [ ] Conduct manual testing of all user interactions
- [ ] Test performance with extreme simulation parameters
- [ ] Perform cross-browser testing on major browsers
- [ ] Test on different devices and screen sizes
- [ ] Conduct long-duration simulation stability tests
- [ ] Create a bug tracking and prioritization system
- [ ] Fix all critical and high-priority bugs
- [ ] Address edge cases and unusual usage patterns
- [ ] Optimize performance bottlenecks identified during testing
- [ ] Polish visual elements and animations
- [ ] Conduct user experience testing
- [ ] Create a final pre-release checklist
- [ ] Perform regression testing after bug fixes

## Success Criteria
- No critical or high-priority bugs remain
- Application works consistently across supported browsers
- Performance is acceptable even with large simulations
- User experience is polished and intuitive
- All features work as documented

## Dependencies
- All previous implementation tasks must be completed

## Notes
- Prioritize bugs by severity and impact on user experience
- Consider creating a beta testing program with external users
- Document workarounds for any known issues that cannot be fixed
- Consider accessibility testing as part of the process
- Performance testing should include various hardware configurations

## Post-process
- [ ] Create a known issues document if necessary
- [ ] Update all documentation to reflect any changes made
- [ ] Prepare release notes

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All implementation steps completed
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] Testing thoroughly covers all features
- [ ] Task fully addresses all requirements
- [ ] Bug fixes don't introduce new issues
- [ ] Performance is acceptable under various conditions
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect final state

## Final Steps
- [ ] Mark the task as completed in TODO.md
- [ ] Commit the changes with a conventional commit message format
