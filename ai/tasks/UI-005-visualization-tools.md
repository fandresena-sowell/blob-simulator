# UI-005: Add Visualization Tools for Evolutionary Progress

## Reference Files
The following files should be referenced when working on this task:
- ai/TODO.md (For understanding project context and dependencies)
- ai/tasks/EVO-001-natural-selection.md (Natural selection system data to visualize)
- ai/tasks/SIM-001-slime-dna-genetics.md (DNA system that's being tracked)
- ai/tasks/UI-001-information-panel.md (Information panel integration)

## Overview
Create visualization tools that allow users to observe and analyze evolutionary trends in the slime population over time. This will help users understand how traits change across generations and how natural selection operates in the simulation.

## Requirements
- Implement charts and graphs showing genetic trait changes over time
- Create population composition visualization
- Add trait distribution analysis tools
- Visualize evolutionary relationships between slime types
- Make visualizations intuitive, interactive, and informative

## Init
- [ ] Read existing documentation and acknowledge the project
- [ ] Understand how evolutionary data is currently tracked
- [ ] Research visualization libraries compatible with Excalibur.js

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Select and integrate a suitable visualization library (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js)
- [ ] Create a `VisualizationManager` class to collect and prepare data
- [ ] Implement data collection for genetic traits over time
- [ ] Add line charts to show trait value changes across generations
- [ ] Create population distribution charts (histograms, pie charts)
- [ ] Implement trait correlation visualizations
- [ ] Add phylogenetic tree or network visualization (optional)
- [ ] Create heatmaps for displaying trait distribution spatially
- [ ] Implement time controls for viewing historical data
- [ ] Add export functionality for visualization data
- [ ] Create UI panels for displaying and controlling visualizations
- [ ] Implement interactive elements (hover details, zoom, filtering)
- [ ] Add visual highlighting to connect visualizations with actual slimes

## Success Criteria
- Multiple visualization types available for different aspects of evolution
- Visualizations update in real-time or on demand
- Users can explore historical evolutionary data
- Visualizations are intuitive and informative
- Tools integrate well with the rest of the UI

## Dependencies
- EVO-001: Natural Selection (for evolutionary data)
- SIM-001: Slime DNA/Genetics System (for trait data)
- UI-001: Information Panel (optional integration)

## Notes
- Balance detail and clarity in visualizations
- Consider performance impact of data collection and visualization
- Think about how to handle visualizations for very large populations
- Consider implementing data sampling or aggregation for efficiency
- Accessibility should be considered (colorblind-friendly palettes, etc.)

## Post-process
- [ ] Update project documentation to reflect the changes made
- [ ] Document how to interpret the visualizations

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All implementation steps completed
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] Visualization tools thoroughly tested with various scenarios
- [ ] Task fully addresses all requirements
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Implementation thoroughly tested
- [ ] Documentation updated as needed

## Final Steps
- [ ] Mark the task as completed in TODO.md
- [ ] Commit the changes with a conventional commit message format
