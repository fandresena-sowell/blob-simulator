# DOC-001: Create User Guide for Simulation Controls

## Reference Files
The following files should be referenced when working on this task:
- ai/TODO.md (For understanding project context and dependencies)
- ai/tasks/UI-002-simulation-controls.md (Simulation controls implementation)
- ai/tasks/UI-003-slime-selection.md (Slime selection functionality)
- ai/tasks/UI-004-save-load-functionality.md (Save/load features)
- ai/tasks/UI-005-visualization-tools.md (Visualization tools)

## Overview
Create a comprehensive user guide that explains all simulation controls, features, and interactions to help users effectively use and understand the slime ecosystem simulator.

## Requirements
- Document all user interface controls and features
- Create clear, concise instructions for basic and advanced usage
- Include visual aids (screenshots, diagrams) where helpful
- Make the guide accessible for users of different experience levels
- Ensure the guide is easy to update as features change

## Init
- [ ] Read existing documentation and acknowledge the project
- [ ] Review all user interface features and controls
- [ ] Plan the structure and format of the user guide

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create a basic outline of guide sections and topics
- [ ] Document basic navigation and camera controls
- [ ] Explain simulation control features (play, pause, speed adjustments)
- [ ] Document slime selection and tracking functionality
- [ ] Create a section on using visualization tools
- [ ] Explain save/load functionality
- [ ] Document any advanced features and experimental tools
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common issues
- [ ] Create visual aids (screenshots, diagrams, icons)
- [ ] Implement guide organization with clear sections and index
- [ ] Add search functionality for the guide (if implemented as HTML)
- [ ] Create printer-friendly version (if applicable)
- [ ] Implement guide in appropriate format (HTML, PDF, in-app)

## Success Criteria
- Guide covers all simulation controls and features
- Instructions are clear and easy to follow
- Visual aids effectively illustrate concepts
- Guide is well-organized and navigable
- Content is accurate and up-to-date with current features

## Dependencies
- UI-002: Simulation Controls
- UI-003: Slime Selection
- UI-004: Save/Load Functionality
- UI-005: Visualization Tools

## Notes
- Consider different user experience levels in the documentation
- Use consistent terminology throughout the guide
- Visual aids should be clear and properly labeled
- Consider creating both quick reference and detailed versions
- May want to include examples of common tasks or scenarios

## Post-process
- [ ] Have multiple people review the guide for clarity and completeness
- [ ] Test guide instructions with users unfamiliar with the system

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All implementation steps completed
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] Guide thoroughly tested with various user personas
- [ ] Task fully addresses all requirements
- [ ] No factual errors or misleading instructions
- [ ] Guide covers all current features
- [ ] Documentation is clear and well-organized

## Final Steps
- [ ] Mark the task as completed in TODO.md
- [ ] Commit the changes with a conventional commit message format
