## Overview
Implement an in-app help system with tooltips, contextual guides, and interactive tutorials to help users understand the simulation features and mechanics during use. This will improve user experience and reduce the learning curve for the simulation.

## Requirements
- Add informative tooltips for all UI elements
- Create contextual help for complex features
- Implement an optional guided tutorial for new users
- Add help icons and information buttons where appropriate
- Ensure help content is concise, useful, and non-intrusive

## Init
- [ ] Read existing documentation and acknowledge the project
- [ ] Review all user interface elements
- [ ] Plan the structure and content of the help system

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create a `HelpSystem` class to manage tooltips and guides
- [ ] Implement tooltip display system for UI elements
- [ ] Add tooltip content for all interactive elements
- [ ] Create context-sensitive help for complex features
- [ ] Implement a guided tutorial system for new users
- [ ] Add help icons and information buttons to key UI elements
- [ ] Create a help overlay system for explaining complex screens
- [ ] Implement progressive disclosure of help (based on user experience)
- [ ] Add a "help mode" toggle for detailed explanations
