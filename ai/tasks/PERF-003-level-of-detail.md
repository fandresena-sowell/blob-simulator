# PERF-003: Add Level of Detail System for Distant Slimes

## Reference Files
The following files should be referenced when working on this task:
- ai/TODO.md (For understanding project context and dependencies)
- src/actors/slime.ts (Slime rendering and behavior implementation)
- src/level.ts (Level management)
- ai/tasks/PERF-001-slime-rendering-optimization.md (Rendering optimization strategy)

## Overview
Implement a level of detail (LOD) system that reduces the visual complexity and behavioral simulation detail of slimes based on their distance from the camera or focus point. This optimization will enable the simulation to handle larger numbers of slimes by reducing processing for entities that are not in the immediate focus.

## Requirements
- Create a multi-level LOD system for slimes
- Reduce visual detail for distant slimes
- Simplify behavior calculations for distant slimes
- Implement smooth transitions between LOD levels
- Ensure LOD system works with camera movement and zoom

## Init
- [ ] Read existing documentation and acknowledge the project
- [ ] Understand the current slime rendering and behavior systems
- [ ] Research LOD techniques suitable for 2D simulations

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create a `LODManager` class to handle distance-based detail levels
- [ ] Define multiple detail levels with specific criteria (distance thresholds)
- [ ] Implement simplified graphics for distant slimes (fewer animation frames, reduced effects)
- [ ] Create simplified behavior patterns for distant slimes
- [ ] Add group simulation for very distant slimes (treating clusters as a single entity)
- [ ] Implement LOD transitions that avoid popping or visual artifacts
- [ ] Add culling for extremely distant or off-screen slimes
- [ ] Create a priority system for slimes of interest (user-selected, unique traits)
- [ ] Implement visibility checks to disable updates for hidden slimes
- [ ] Add configuration options for LOD distance thresholds and detail levels
- [ ] Create debug visualization for LOD levels
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for different LOD representations

## Success Criteria
- Significant performance improvement with large numbers of slimes
- Visual quality remains high for nearby slimes
- Transitions between LOD levels are smooth and not distracting
- Behavior simulation remains believable at all detail levels
- System adapts to camera movement and zoom levels

## Dependencies
- PERF-001: Optimize Rendering for Large Numbers of Slimes

## Notes
- Balance visual quality with performance gains
- Consider how LOD affects behavior emergence and ecosystem simulation
- Think about prioritizing slimes with unique or interesting traits
- Consider implementing importance-based LOD (not just distance-based)
- The LOD system should integrate with the camera and interaction systems

## Post-process
- [ ] Update project documentation to reflect the changes made
- [ ] Document the LOD system and its performance characteristics
